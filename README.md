# Wunderlist 2 - Alfred Extension

With this extension you can easily add new tasks to Wunderlist using [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com). To use it you need to already have Alfred version 2 installed and you need to have a Powerpack.

And older version, which is still comaptible with Alfred version 1 can be downloaded at the end of this post.

Installation
----

Simply double click on the `Wunderlist 2.alfredworkflow` extension to install it. You need to use the newest beta version of Alfred to use this extension.

How to use
----

My extension is really easy to use. You just have to keystroke **wl** followed by *the task you want to enter*, hit the return key and the task will be added to you're active list in Wunderlist. 

Example
----

`wl Clean my Desk`
-> This adds a new task to your list using the name "Clean my Desk".
