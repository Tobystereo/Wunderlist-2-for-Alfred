# Wunderlist 2 - Alfred Extension

This is a fork of the Alfred to Wunderlist 2 workflow by (Sébastien Etter)[https://github.com/sebietter] that adds the task to your task list and does not just paste it into the new task field requiring the user to press the enter key to actually add it. 

With this extension you can easily add new tasks to Wunderlist using [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com). To use it you need to already have Alfred version 2 installed and you need to have a Powerpack.

Installation
----

Simply double click on the `Wunderlist 2.alfredworkflow` extension to install it. You need to use the newest beta version of Alfred to use this extension.

How to use
----

My extension is really easy to use. You just have to keystroke **wl** followed by *the task you want to enter*, hit the return key and the task will be added to you're active list in Wunderlist. 

Example
----

`wl Clean my Desk`
-> This adds a new task to your list using the name "Clean my Desk".
